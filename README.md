## A project to analyze Covid-19 numbers in Italy
### Material used for Bachelor Degree thesis in Political Science and Economics


In this folder I report a project about the critical reading of Covid-19 data. It took place in early stage of pandemic and It wanted to be a discussion about how to read critically **descriptive and predictive models** about something that affected and still does, our lives radically.
Many revolutions are taking place, and one of the most important is the scientific one: post normal science is coming more and more visible to everybody.
Here I report also the code I developed for some graphs and gifs. 
This code takes aggregated national data from the GitHub of Civil Protection Department of Italy (<https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19>), and after some manipulation returns graphs and gifs.

There are three sections accessible in the upper panel, and they are named (in order from the left to the right): `Age Ranges`, `Best Regions` and `Analysis`.

### How to critically read Covid-19 data.pdf

This is the document of the final dissertation of the thesis. It is a discussion about the reading of Covid-19 data in the initial stages of pandemics.


### COVID_19_code.ipynb

This is the Jupyter notebook document of the data manipulation and visualization of the national aggregate.

### COVID_19_code-regions.ipynb

This is the Jupyter notebook document of the data manipulation and visualization of the regional aggregate.
