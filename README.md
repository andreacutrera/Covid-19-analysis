# Covid-19-code
In this folder I report a project about the critical reading of Covid-19 data. It took place in early stage of pandemic and It wanted to be a discussion about how to read critically descriptive and predictive models about something affected and still does, our lives radically.
Many revolutions are taking place, and one of the most important is the scientific one: post normal science is coming more and more visible to everybody.
Here I report also the code I developed for some graphs and gifs. 
This code takes aggregated national data from the GitHub of Civil Protection Department of Italy, and after some manipulation returns graphs and gifs.
